"This movie was absolutely fantastic, I loved every second of it."
"Terrible film, complete waste of time and money."
An outstanding performance by the lead actor.
The plot was confusing and the ending made no sense.
"I was pleasantly surprised, much better than expected."
Boring and predictable from start to finish.
"A masterpiece of modern cinema, highly recommend."
The special effects were cheap and the acting was wooden.
One of the best films I have seen in years.
Dull storyline with zero character development.
Incredibly moving and beautifully shot film.
"I fell asleep halfway through, that bad."
Great direction and an amazing soundtrack.
"Overrated, does not live up to the hype at all."
A heartwarming story that the whole family will enjoy.
The dialogue was cringe-worthy and unnatural.
Brilliant script and superb acting throughout.
"Nothing original here, just recycled old ideas."
Visually stunning with a compelling narrative.
I cannot believe how much time I wasted watching this.
